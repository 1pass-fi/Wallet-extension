          Decentralized Identities (DID) are here! Now you can link your different keys to one ID and create a personalized profile too. Each DID is an NFT stored on Arweave and it can be updated right from Finnie.

          <div className='paragraph'>
          With your profile, you can add a profile photo (show off your coolest PFP) and a cover photo from your NFT collection. Add a description and any links you want, so people can follow you on social media or find your portfolio.

          We fixed a bug that affected signing transactions and sending AR, so now Finnie should be compatible with other Arweave apps. You can now pause Finnie for a specific webpage if you need to for any reason. If you encounter a problem, please let us know with a <a style={{ color: '#49ce8b' }} href='https://koii.me/support'

          <div className='paragraph'>
          Weâ€™re currently working on speeding up transaction times and giving Finnie a new look, so keep an eye out!
